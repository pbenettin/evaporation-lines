Basic implementation of the Craig-Gordon model to compute the heavy isotope enrichment of evaporating waters

This MATLAB code adapts the Craig-Gordon model to the case of a soil water volume evaporating into the atmosphere. The code implements the equations that determine the enrichment in heavy isotopes due to equilibrium and kinetic fractionation effects. The code is ready to go and provides examples for the case of a single water source and for a seasonally variable climate and water sources.

The code is the basis for all the analyses in:
